To record a trace, first letâ€™s get you set up.

These preparatory steps only need to be once.

### 1. Install [PS Companion app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ps.companion&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) 

You will use PS Companion app later to upload traces and screen recordings to PS Tool.

### 2. Log in with your PS Tool credentials

To log in to PS Companion app, you can use the same credentials you created while registering at productscience.app or use Google authentication.

### 3. Make sure tracing is enabled
Individual phones may have different ways to do this, but these are general guidelines. **Please review these settings even if you are familiar with trace recording on Android, there are some specific settings**
