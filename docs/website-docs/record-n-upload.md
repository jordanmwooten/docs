### 3. Select a user flow you want to analyze

At Product Science, performance optimization starts with defining key user flows that bring the most value to users.

##### What is a user flow?

There are several ways to select a user flow:

- (**preferred**) __An "Action-Reaction" one step flow__. Here the user starts with an Action (pressing a button, swiping, selecting a menu item, etc) and you measure until a "Reaction", such as a new page being fully displayed. These flows are clean and simple to analyze
- __More complex flows__. Sometimes, there are multiple that need to be strung together to get an idea of the performance of a feature. It can make sense to have flows like these, but consider carefully if they cannot be broken into smaller parts.

Either way, a sequence of functions execute before the user finally arrives at a final state. This is where our AI technology comes into playâ€”highlighting these sequences that formed into what we call __execution paths__.

**Flows should be short, in the order of 30 seconds, to enable the analysis to be a manageable size**
